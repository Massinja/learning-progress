Things I figured out on my own, playing-coding    

**Array properties**
- unshift() - inserts given value at the beginning of the array, returns length of the array
- push() - inserts given value at the end of the array, returns length of the array  
- shift() - deletes first element of the array, returns its value; accepts random values, but that doesn't change its behaviour
- pop() - deletes last element of the array, returns its value

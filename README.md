# learning-progress
I am certainly passionate about tech (and people)! I am also in constant need of learning and figuring out how things work.  
My only issue is without a specific plan I am lost and unproductive.  
There are thousands of learning resources, technologies, and frameworks. Even if I won't need it in the future, it all seems to be useful, and it expands my mind. But another day goes by. And I am still unemloyed and not sure where I am heading to.    
At first, I will try to document here everything I learn. Then, I'll try to analyze it and adjust my course.  

My daily log is [here](https://github.com/Massinja/learning-progress/blob/main/day-log.md)

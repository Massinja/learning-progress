# learning-progress
I am certainly passionate about tech (and people)! I am also in constant need of learning and figuring out how things work.  
My only issue is without a specific plan I am lost and unproductive.  
There are thousands of learning resources, technologies, and frameworks. Even if I won't need it in the future, it all seems to be useful, and it expands my mind. But another day goes by. And I am still unemloyed and not sure where I am heading to.    
At first, I will try to document here everything I learn. Then, I'll try to analyze it and adjust my course.  

## Skills I want to focus on in the nearest future  
(my thoughts on May 17, 2023):  
I heard that getting a job as a QA engineer is easier at my level of skill and knowledge.   
In the morning I was going to stick with Manual and Automated QA Engineering. But as the day went by tweaking Javascript code, I realized that deep inside I like Golang :) I helped someone with their code, and noticed how buggy JS can be! Oh my! Do I want to work with such language? Only if I am paid well :p

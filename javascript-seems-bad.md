Javascript will let me compare variables of different types. Why would we compare apples and oranges :(

Javascript will let me reassign a value within an "if statement". That is completely broken.

Scope of the variable should end at the end of the innermost containing block, but not in JS :( again such an assignment within the if statement should not be even allowed

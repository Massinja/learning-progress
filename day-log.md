# my thoughts  
### May 17, 2023:  
I heard that getting a job as a QA engineer is easier at my level of skill and knowledge.   
In the morning I was going to stick with Manual and Automated QA Engineering, particularly using Javascript for Automation. 
But as the day went by tweaking Javascript code, I realized that deep inside I like Golang :)  
I helped someone with their code, and noticed [how buggy JS can be!](https://github.com/Massinja/learning-progress/blob/main/javascript-seems-bad.md) Oh my! Do I want to work with such language? Only if I am paid well :p

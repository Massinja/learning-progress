I heard that getting a job as a QA engineer is easier at my level of skill and knowledge.   
In the morning I was going to stick with Manual and Automated QA Engineering, particularly using Javascript for Automation. 
But as the day went by tweaking Javascript code, I realized that deep inside I like Golang :)  
I helped someone with their code, and noticed [how buggy JS can be!](https://github.com/Massinja/learning-progress/blob/main/javascript-seems-bad.md) Oh my! Do I want to work with such language?

Time flies by so fast that I should rename this file to a monthly log :D  
I have not really made much progress. As usual the only way to learn is to do. But, I am not doing much! Although, I am still interested in programming and hoping to study hard.   
I started Wordle-bot project in Bash, and it certainly helped me to learn a lot about Bash.  
In order to strengthen my keyboard and terminal skills I have been only coding in Vim.  
Blogging in a month with better news.
